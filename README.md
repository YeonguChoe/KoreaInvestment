# Korea Investment & Securities Algorithm trading
In Korean stock market, every home trading software runs on only Windows.
Some people have great trading knowledge but don't have coding experience.
I made this python OOP script for the people who only have Mac or have great trading knowledge but little to no coding experience to be able to do system trading.
